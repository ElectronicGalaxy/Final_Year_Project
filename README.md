# Final_Year_Project

<h2>Mathematical Calculator - Introduction</h2>
For my final year project at University of Westminster, I created the "mathematical calculator" that can calculate the answers of various mathematical and physics questions. For example, the software can solve an equations such as "x + 2 = 10x - 1" or "x^2 + 10x + 16". The project was made in mind for GCSE students, A-level students and those like me with a keen interest in mathematics and physics.

<h2>Software Description</h2>
Software can perform the following functions such as
- Calculate equations of many kinds (linear, quadratic, exponential, trigonometric).
- Convert rectangular coordinates into polar form and convert polar coordinates into rectangular form.
- Differentiate and integrate functions.
- Factorise algebraic expressions.
- Evaluate hyperbolic functions.
- Performs arithmetic like a normal calculator.
- Can solve systems of equations.
- Can calculate physics problems such as inclined plane, projectile motion, parallel RLC circuit, resonant circuits and more.
- Graph mathematical functions.
- Allows you to create simple electronic circuits and provides information based on the type of circuit and values entered.
- Teaches you the topics covered in the project and allows you to take a test.

The software calculator uses a number of libraries such as, "Sympy", "Numpy"
