# Final_Year_Project

<h2>Mathematical Calculator</h2>
For my final year project at University of Westminster, I created the mathematical calculator that can calculate the answers of various mathematical and physics questions. For example, the software can solve an equations such as "x + 2 = 10x - 1" or "x^2 + 10x + 16". The project was made in mind for GCSE students, A-level students and those like me with a keen interest in mathematics and physics.

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple PowerShell script that walks the user through "zeroing out" (wiping) any drives that are connected to the system. The utility allows you to select the target disk and choose the number of passes that are performed. The PowerShell script will configure a diskpart script file based on the user's selections and then launch Diskpart to perform the disk sanitization.
