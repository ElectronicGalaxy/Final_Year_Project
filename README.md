# Final_Year_Project

<h2>Mathematical Calculator - Introduction</h2>
For my final year project at University of Westminster, I created the "mathematical calculator" that can calculate the answers of various mathematical and physics questions. For example, the software can solve an equations such as "x + 2 = 10x - 1" or "x^2 + 10x + 16". The project was made in mind for GCSE students, A-level students and those like me with a keen interest in mathematics and physics.
<br />
<br />
The software was developed using Python, due to the large wealth of libraries that the language has, such as Sympy, Numpy, Tkinter, Pillow and more. These libraries are what allows the software project to perform intensive calculations within seconds.

<h2>Software Description</h2>
Software can perform the following functions such as:
<br />
<br />
- Calculate equations of many kinds (linear, quadratic, exponential, trigonometric).
<br />
<br />
- Convert rectangular coordinates into polar form and convert polar coordinates into rectangular form.
<br />
<br />
- Differentiate and integrate functions.
<br />
<br />
- Factorise algebraic expressions.
<br />
<br />
- Evaluate hyperbolic functions.
<br />
<br />
- Performs arithmetic like a normal calculator.
<br />
<br />
- Can solve systems of equations.
<br />
<br />
- Can calculate physics problems such as inclined plane, projectile motion, parallel RLC circuit, resonant circuits and more.
<br />
<br />
- Graph mathematical functions.
<br />
<br />
- Allows you to create simple electronic circuits and provides information based on the type of circuit and values entered.
<br />
<br />
- Teaches you the topics covered in the project and allows you to take a test.
<br />
<br />
The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used to program with Python and Tkinter, is IDLE (Python 3.9 64-bit).The software calculator uses a number of libraries such as, "Sympy", "Numpy"
